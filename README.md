# Innoguide---The-autonomous-humanoid-Guide-robot
Innoguide is an Autonomous Humanoid Guide Robot, thats aimed to be deployed in the CFI (Centre for Innovation Building @IITMadras)
<br>
This Repo Contains my Progress for the tenure May'23 to April'24.
<br>
As A Project member For the project innoguide, I've worked on Fusion 360, TinkerCAD, Arduino, Jetson NANO, and ROS.
<br>
We Designed The Chassis (Aluminium Skeleton Frame Structure of the Robot) and Tested it in Ansys( A simulation software that tests bodies), and Achieved a Succesful Strength Factor.
<br>
Designed the outer Cover for the robot, that sits on the Skeleton structure and 3D Printed the Cover Using PLA.
<br>
Designed the Electrical Circuitry of the Robot, and Integrated All the sensors and Primary Components.
<br>
Studied the Power Isolation Techniques to Seperate 12V and 5V Power supplies.
<br>
Worked on Cytron Motor Driver, that takes PWM Values from Arduino and Runs the Motors accordingly.
<br>
Desiged a Costum PCB - the PWM Switcher, that switches between the command(PWM) lines of Jetson Nano and ESP32.
<br>
Used Two ESP32s, One inside the Robot, and One with the joystick, To Control the robot manually using ESP-PEER-to-PEER communication protocol and Controlled it Wirelessly with a range of 50Mts.
<br>
Integrated All the Sensors and Components using Arduino to the Jetson Nano(The master computer for the robot) and Created Seperate Control Nodes.
